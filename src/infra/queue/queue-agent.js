/**
 * By default it's initiated inside `Hull.Connector` as a very simplistic in-memory queue, but in case of production grade needs, it comes with a [Kue](https://github.com/Automattic/kue) or [Bull](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull) adapters which you can initiate in a following way:
 *
 * `Options` from the constructor of the `BullAdapter` or `KueAdapter` are passed directly to the internal init method and can be set with following parameters:
 *
 * <https://github.com/Automattic/kue#redis-connection-settings> <https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/master/REFERENCE.md#queue>
 *
 * The `queue` instance has a `contextMiddleware` method which adds `req.hull.enqueue` method to queue jobs - this is done automatically by `Hull.Connector().setupApp(app)`:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * req.hull.enqueue((jobName = ''), (jobPayload = {}), (options = {}));
 * ```
 *
 * By default the job will be retried 3 times and the payload would be removed from queue after successfull completion.
 *
 * Then the handlers to work on a specific jobs is defined in following way:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * connector.worker({
 *   jobsName: (ctx, jobPayload) => {
 *     // process Payload
 *     // this === job (kue job object)
 *     // return Promise
 *   }
 * });
 * connector.startWorker();
 * ```
 * @deprecated internal connector queue is considered an antipattern, this class is kept only for backward compatiblity
 * @memberof Infra
 * @public
 * @param {Object} adapter
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * const { Queue } = require("hull/lib/infra");
 * const BullAdapter = require("hull/lib/infra/queue/adapter/bull"); // or KueAdapter
 *
 * const queueAdapter = new BullAdapter(options);
 * const queue = new Queue(queueAdapter);
 *
 * const connector = new Hull.Connector({ queue });
 * ```
