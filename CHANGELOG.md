# 0.13.11
* this release brings bigger changes to error handling:
  - it cleans up a little middleware stack including smart-notifier errors
  - it introduces two types of errors - `unhandled error` which is handled the same as till now, and `transient error` which won't be pushed to sentry, but only instrumented in datadog
  - it deprecates dedicated smartNotifierErrorMiddleware
  - smartNotifierHandler in case of error behaves like notifHandler and pass the error down the middleware stack
